# Building-Image-Detector
Numerical Methods Project

The project, developed in Python, utilizes numerical methods to identify images of various buildings within a database and provides specific information regarding the structural rigidity of each building. Users are prompted to input certain data, through which the application calculates and determines how the building reacts to seismic activity. By leveraging numerical techniques, the application offers insights into the behavior of buildings during earthquakes, aiding in the assessment of their structural integrity and resilience.
